# AMP tutorial

Repository totally based on the [AMP tutorial](https://github.com/sphinxteam/AMP_tutorial) provided by the [SPHINX team](https://github.com/sphinxteam).

The goal is to play with the notebooks provided by SPHINX team and learn a little bit about Approximated Message Passing algorithms.
